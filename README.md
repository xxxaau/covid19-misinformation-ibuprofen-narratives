# Misinformation in action

This repository contains the data for:

Xaudiera, S; Cardenal, A.S. (2020). Ibuprofen narratives in five European countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. *The Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) Misinformation Review*. https://doi.org/10.37016/mr-2020-029

In this case study we have explored how alternative narratives about Ibuprofen travelled through different European territories in the context of the COVID-19 global pandemic. To investigate this case, we have relied on data collected from Twitter API using R and the rtweet library (Kearney, 2019). Starting on March 11, and until March 28, 2020, we captured (N= 809,072) tweets using one of the three following words: “ibuprofen,” “ibuprofeno,” or “ibuprofene.” Thus, our data has been selected using relevant keywords. Applying social network analysis, we identified the center of the conversation in five European territories: Germany, France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands.
